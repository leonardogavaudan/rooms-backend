# Description

The aim of this project was mainly to learn about infrastructure, CI-CD, AWS, and Terraform

I created a very simple CRUD application in Typescritpt + Node.js to have a minimal backend to deploy

## AWS

### Running the servers

First question I had to ask myself was what AWS service I was going to use to run the servers that handle incoming client requests

My main choices were

- Lambda
- EC2
- ECS
- EKS
